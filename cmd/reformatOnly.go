// reformatOnlyCmd represents the reformatOnly command
var reformatOnlyCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "only [directory / path to .sec file]",
	Short: "Only applies the reformat command to one file in the specified directory/path",
	Long: `Only applies the reformat command to one *asm.sec file in the specified directory or path.

The directory is searched recursively until all *asm.sec files are found.
The specified directory must not contain more than one *asm.sec file recursively. 
Calling "reformat only" on a directory that has more than one *asm.sec file will fail.
Thus in order for this condition to be met it might be required that you specify the path all the way to the single file you want to reformat. 

Examples:
  ratte reformat only assignment1
  ratte reformat only assignment1/some_file.sec`,
	Args: cobra.ExactArgs(1),
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("reformat only sub command called")
	},
}

func init() {
	reformatCmd.AddCommand(reformatOnlyCmd)
}
